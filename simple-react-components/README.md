#### Installation

Assuming that you have Tandem (closed beta), and NodeJS installed, go ahead and executed this command in the `cwd` of this directory:

```
npm install && webpack --watch
```

Next, in a separate terminal window, go ahead and run:

```
tandem out/index.html
```

Tandem at this point should open the a new window with `out/index.html`. From there, hold ctrl/cmd & click any element to open its source code in your
text editor.
